## ZetaChain 1

- ZC is a decentralized cross-blockchain smart contract platform on top of which cross-blockchain applications can be built as smart contracts.
- Enabling interoperability between blockchains is core to its purpose.
- ZC is built in the Cosmos eco-system.
- Being built in Cosmos, specific architecural properties and reqs may create unique security vulns.
- ZC is constructed using components like Cosmos SDK, Tendermint Consensus Engine(CometBFT sdk v46.13), and IBC.
- Custom module locale should be scrutinized: crosschain, emissions, fungible, observer.
- Consider vulns of Go-based origins.
- Validator landscape exploitations?
- TSS exploitation? Key extraction attack? TSSHOCK.

- Key architecture patterns: 
- Composable units of functionality with handlers for updating dedicated parts of state (”Modules”)
- Getters and Setters for each module’s state (”Keepers”)
- Access controls for state updates (”Stores and Object Capabilities”)
- A convention for interfacing with a consensus and networking layer through a lifecycle of events (“CometBFT”, ”ABCI”, “Protobuf”)
- Handlers to modify state according to transaction payloads and RPC requests (”Messages”, and “Queries”)

- Core codebase: 
- app/ : Cosmos SDK custom app (ZetaChain) interfaces and implementations
- cmd/ : The scaffolding for handling commands through the CLI, and the entry point for generating the zetacored and zetaclientd binaries
- common/ : helpers and methods used throughout the app, custom modules, and tests
- proto/ : protobuf definitions for Messages and Queries
- x/: custom Cosmos SDK modules referenced in the ZetaChain app
- zetaclient/ : this is the off-chain ZetaClient server used for querying data from targets chain and creating messages and signing cross chain transactions
- server/ : CLI interface for starting the ZetaCore/Blockchain processes, ultimately used by zetacored
