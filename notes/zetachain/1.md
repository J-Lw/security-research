## ZetaChain 1

- ZC is a decentralized cross-blockchain smart contract platform on top of which cross-blockchain applications can be built as smart contracts.
- Enabling interoperability between blockchains is core to its purpose.
- ZC is built in the Cosmos eco-system.
- Being built in Cosmos, specific architecural properties and reqs may create unique security vulns.
- ZC is constructed using components like Cosmos SDK, Tendermint Consensus Engine(CometBFT sdk v46.13), and IBC.
- Custom module locale should be scrutinized: crosschain, emissions, fungible, observer.
- Consider vulns of Go-based origins.
- Validator landscape exploitations?
- TSS exploitation? Key extraction attack? TSSHOCK.

- Key architecture patterns: 
- Composable units of functionality with handlers for updating dedicated parts of state (”Modules”)
- Getters and Setters for each module’s state (”Keepers”)
- Access controls for state updates (”Stores and Object Capabilities”)
- A convention for interfacing with a consensus and networking layer through a lifecycle of events (“CometBFT”, ”ABCI”, “Protobuf”)
- Handlers to modify state according to transaction payloads and RPC requests (”Messages”, and “Queries”)

- Core codebase: 
- app/ : Cosmos SDK custom app (ZetaChain) interfaces and implementations
- cmd/ : The scaffolding for handling commands through the CLI, and the entry point for generating the zetacored and zetaclientd binaries
- common/ : helpers and methods used throughout the app, custom modules, and tests
- proto/ : protobuf definitions for Messages and Queries
- x/: custom Cosmos SDK modules referenced in the ZetaChain app
- zetaclient/ : this is the off-chain ZetaClient server used for querying data from targets chain and creating messages and signing cross chain transactions
- server/ : CLI interface for starting the ZetaCore/Blockchain processes, ultimately used by zetacored

- Inbound Transaction Observation Test Cases:

   -  Basic Flow:
        - Positive Test: Send a CCTX to ZetaChain with a valid message. Ensure that ZRC20 tokens are correctly deposited and the contract on ZetaChain is triggered.
        - Negative Test: Send a CCTX to ZetaChain without any message. Confirm that no ZRC20 tokens are deposited and no contract on ZetaChain is triggered.
    - Contract Address and Arguments Validity:
        - Positive Test: Send a CCTX with a valid contract address and arguments. Check for successful execution.
        - Negative Test: Send a CCTX with an invalid contract address but valid arguments. Ensure the transaction fails.
    - Chain Destination Handling:
        - Positive Test: Send a CCTX where the destination chain is not ZetaChain. Confirm that the status changes to "pending outbound".
        - Negative Test: Send a CCTX without specifying a destination chain. Ensure that there's a clear error or default behavior.
    - Token Amount Verification:
        - Positive Test: Send a CCTX with a specified amount of ZRC20 tokens. Ensure that the exact amount is minted/burned on ZetaChain.
        - Negative Test: Send a CCTX with a zero or negative token amount. Confirm that the transaction is either rejected or handled appropriately.
    - Gas Payment Handling:
        - Positive Test: Ensure that when ZRC20 tokens are deposited, the appropriate amount of gas is charged.
        - Negative Test: Send a CCTX with insufficient gas. Ensure that the transaction is rejected.
    - Concurrency and Multiple Transactions:
        - Positive Test: Send multiple valid CCTXs in rapid succession. Verify that all transactions are processed correctly without any loss or mismanagement of tokens.
    - Rate Limiting and Throttling:
        - Negative Test: Send a large number of CCTXs in a very short time span to test the system's rate limiting and throttling capabilities.
    - Replay Attack Prevention:
        - Negative Test: Send a CCTX, then try to send the same CCTX again. Ensure that the second transaction is rejected or handled appropriately to prevent double deposits.
    - Transaction Timeout:
        - Negative Test: Initiate an inbound transaction but let it not complete. Check how the system handles transactions that don't complete within a given timeframe.
    - Network Issues and Recovery:
        - Negative Test: Simulate network disconnections or delays during the CCTX process. Ensure that transactions can recover once the network is stable, or they fail gracefully.
    - Error Messaging:
        - Negative Test: Send various invalid CCTXs (e.g., wrong format, missing fields, incorrect token amounts). For each, verify that the error messages returned are descriptive and helpful.
    - Transaction Logging and Monitoring:
        - Positive Test: For every inbound transaction, ensure there is a detailed log available which can be used for troubleshooting or audit purposes.
    - Fees and Additional Costs:
        - Positive Test: Send a CCTX and confirm that any additional fees or costs associated with the transaction (beyond the gas) are correctly applied and transparent to the user.
    - External Chain Behavior:
        - Negative Test: Send a CCTX from an external chain that is experiencing congestion or issues. Observe how ZetaChain handles these potentially delayed or problematic transactions.
    - Third-party Service Integration:
        - Positive Test: If there are any third-party services integrated (like oracles), ensure their data input or triggers work seamlessly with the inbound transaction process.

- Outbound Transaction Observation Test Cases:

    - Basic Flow:
        - Positive Test: Initiate an outbound transaction from ZetaChain. Ensure observers correctly watch the transaction and status changes from "pending outbound" to "final" upon confirmation.
        - Negative Test: Initiate an outbound transaction without proper configuration or missing fields. Confirm that the transaction is rejected or handled appropriately.
    - Observer Monitoring:
        - Positive Test: Ensure observers are actively monitoring ZetaChain for pending outbound transactions and correctly entering the TSS keysign ceremony.
        - Negative Test: Disable or reduce observer count and initiate an outbound transaction. Check for system resilience and error handling.
    - TSS Keysign Ceremony:
        - Positive Test: Ensure that when an observer enters into a TSS keysign ceremony, the transaction is correctly signed.
        - Negative Test: Tamper with the transaction data during the keysign ceremony. Confirm that the compromised transaction is rejected.
    - Transaction Broadcasting to Connected Blockchains:
        - Positive Test: After the keysign ceremony, ensure the signed transaction is correctly broadcasted to the connected blockchains.
        - Negative Test: Simulate a broadcast failure. Check for system resilience and recovery mechanisms.
    - Observing Outbound Transaction Confirmation:
        - Positive Test: Ensure that observers correctly monitor the connected blockchains for transaction confirmations.
        - Negative Test: Delay or prevent a transaction from being confirmed on the connected blockchain. Observe how the ZetaChain system reacts to such delays.
    - Voting on Observed Outbound Transaction:
        - Positive Test: After a transaction is confirmed on a connected blockchain, ensure observers vote on ZetaChain and the voting process functions smoothly.
        - Negative Test: Simulate a scenario where not enough votes are acquired. Verify how the system handles such scenarios.
    - Gas Payment on Outbound Transactions:
        - Positive Test: Ensure that the correct amount of gas is deducted for each type of CCTX (Gas cctx, Zeta cctx, ERC20 cctx) and the swaps function correctly.
        - Negative Test: Send an outbound transaction without sufficient gas or using a non-supported CCTX type. Verify rejection or appropriate handling.
    - Gas Price Increase Mechanism:
        - Positive Test: For an outbound transaction that's pending for an extended period, ensure that the gas price increases as specified.
        - Negative Test: If there are insufficient funds in the gas stability pool, ensure that the gas price does not increase.
    - Concurrency and Multiple Transactions:
        - Positive Test: Initiate multiple outbound transactions in rapid succession. Confirm that all are processed correctly without any issues.
    - Replay Attack Prevention:
        - Negative Test: Send an outbound transaction, then try to resend the same transaction. Confirm the second transaction is handled appropriately to prevent double processing.
    - Error Messaging and Notifications:
        - Negative Test: Initiate outbound transactions with various issues (e.g., wrong format, missing fields). Verify that error messages are descriptive and helpful.
    - Rate Limiting and Throttling:
        - Negative Test: Send a very large number of outbound transactions in a short time span. Observe the system's rate limiting and throttling response.
    - Network Issues and Recovery:
        - Negative Test: Simulate network disconnections or delays during the outbound transaction process. Verify that the system can recover or handle network instabilities gracefully.
    - External Chain Behavior:
        - Negative Test: Send an outbound transaction to an external chain experiencing congestion or issues. Confirm ZetaChain's response to problematic external chains.
    - Third-party Service Integration:
        - Positive Test: If third-party services (e.g., oracles or external APIs) are integrated, ensure their inputs or triggers work well with the outbound transaction process.
    - Monitoring and Logging:
        - Positive Test: Ensure detailed logs are available for every step of the outbound transaction process for troubleshooting or audit purposes.
