## ZC 2

- Vuln classes:

    - Protocol insolvency
    - Cryptographic flaws that could result in leaking private key or allow forging signatures -Compromise of the “TSS Address” that leads to unauthorized transactions or complete private key exposure
    - Unintended minting of ZETA token
    - Loss of user funds by permanent freezing or direct theft
    - Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork)
    - Tamper / manipulate blockchain history to add, invalidate, or change past transactions
    - Temporary Consensus Failures
    - Temporary Chain partition
    - Cheap Denial of Service of Critical Functions of the blockchain
    - Temporary freezing of funds
    - High computation/load to zetaclientd & zetacored
    - DoS to minority of validators
    - Limited impact of denial of service

    - Access Control
    - Ante Handler Issues
    - Block Stuffing
    - Centralization
    - Cross Chain Integration
    - Cryptography.md
    - Denial of Service
    - Frontrunning
    - Math Issues
    - Module Integration
    - Node Configurations
    - Token Usage

- Go language-specific bugs:

    - Integer overflows
    - Non-determinism
    - Loss in precision / Issues with Float associativity

- Cosmos SDK specific vulnerabilities e.g.:

    - Incorrect signers - Broken access controls due to incorrect signers validation
    - Not prioritized messages - Risks arising from usage of not prioritized message types
    - Panics and unbounded computation in BeginBlock/EndBlock which can result in denial of service.
